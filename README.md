# sipridefenseanalysis

Here are my top takeaways/learnings from this project:

1. ðŸ“Š Analyzed SIPRI military expenditure data (1949â€“2024) across countries using Python for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

2. Compared defense spending trends of different countries, visualizing long-term expenditure patterns in constant 2023 US dollars.

3. ðŸ“ˆ Created clear line plots using Seaborn to illustrate country-wise defense expenditure growth over time.
